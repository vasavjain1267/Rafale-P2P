# SETUP GUIDE
## 1. Backend Setup (Flask)

## Virtual Environment Setup

### Creating a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory:
   
bash
``` sh
   cd /path/to/your/project
```

2. Create a virtual environment named venv:
   
bash
``` sh
   python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **On macOS/Linux:**
     
bash
``` sh
     source venv/bin/activate
```

   - **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
     
cmd
``` sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
```

   - **On Windows (PowerShell):**
     
powershell
``` sh
     venv\Scripts\Activate
```


Once activated, your terminal prompt should show (venv), indicating the virtual environment is active.

### Installing Dependencies
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
bash
``` sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Running Your Application
After installing dependencies, you can run your application using:
bash
``` sh
python app.py
```

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment
To exit the virtual environment, simply run:
bash
``` sh
deactivate
```
